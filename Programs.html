Total body splits are known for building muscle and strength, but to take it to truly beastly levels we needed to apply a little mad science. Increased intensity through tried and true techniques as well as dedicated days for training power and a solid recovery plan… The result… TOTAL BEAXST!

                  When done correctly, calisthenics can be an effective way to build muscle and strength. The key is to choose the right exercises for your goals, learn how to perform those exercises so that muscle mass is the end goal, and be consistent with your calisthenics workout routines.
                  
                  Naturally as you get stronger, you want to continue to challenge yourself by trying difficult progressions. The stronger you become, the more you should consistently and appropriately increase some form of variables such as intensity, duration, or frequency.</P>
